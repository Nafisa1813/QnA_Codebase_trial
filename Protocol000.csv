33,INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN,,3
34,Study Design and Duration,"Patients with a recent ACS and/or undergoing PCI for another indication with either active or a  history of NVAF and planned treatment with P2Y12 agent and oral anticoagulation for at least  six months will ideally be evaluated for eligibility during their ACS or PCI hospitalization.  Randomization can be performed up to 14 days after the ACS or PCI and should take place as early as possible after cessation of parenteral anticoagulant and when clinically stable. Both  patients with and without prior VKA treatment can be included in this trial. Patients who are on a  VKA prior to randomization will have VKA discontinued and will not be dosed with apixaban  until the INR is less than 2.0. (Please refer to your countrys approved label language for  apixaban and VKA.)At the time of enrollment, each patient who meets inclusion/exclusion  criteria will be randomized via IVRS using a 2 x 2 factorial design to either apixaban or VKA and to either aspirin or aspirin placebo. Randomization will be stratified by indication at  enrollment (ACS vs PCI). Overall, the trial will include approximately 1/3 of patients with a  recent ACS.",3.1
35,Study Design and Duration,"Approximately 690 sites will participate in this study, which will be conducted globally,  including participation of countries located in North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America.",3.1

39,Post Study Access to Therapy,"   Patients will be contacted by telephone 30 days +/- 7 days after the end of treatment study visit  for additional follow-up. At this contact, bleeding, death/ischemic events, antithrombotic therapy  and INR values will be assessed.",3.2
40,Post Study Access to Therapy,"At the end of the study, BMS will not continue to provide BMS supplied study drug to  subjects/investigators unless BMS chooses to extend the study. The investigator should ensure  that the subject receives appropriate standard of care to treat the condition under study.",3.2
41,Post Study Access to Therapy,"As the oral anticoagulant is not blinded, investigators will be free to choose at the end of the  study whether to continue the apixaban or VKA, or transition to alternative agents. Patients  transitioning from apixaban to vitamin K antagonists should have frequent INR tests during the  first few weeks of transition, as per local standards. Furthermore, investigators will not be  routinely provided blinded aspirin/aspirin placebo assignments until after the final study results  are made public.",3.2

53,Women of Childbearing Potential,"A Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has experienced  menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral  oophorectomy) and is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in  a woman over age 45 years in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In  addition, females under the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone,  (FSH) level > 40mIU/mL to confirm menopause.",3.3.3
54,Women of Childbearing Potential,"Females treated with hormone replacement therapy, (HRT) are likely to have artificially  suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH  level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of  the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the investigators should use their  judgement in checking serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH level is > 40 mIU/ml at any time  during the washout period, the woman can be considered postmenopausal: 1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)  4 week minimum for transdermal products  8 week minimum for oral products Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 months.",3.3.3

59,Discontinuation of Subjects following any Treatment with Study Drug,"Subjects MUST discontinue investigational product (and non-investigational product at the  discretion of the investigator) for any of the following reasons: Subjects request to stop study treatment  Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the  opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the  best interest of the subject  Termination of the study by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS)  Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily incarceration  for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious disease) illness.",3.5
60,Discontinuation of Subjects following any Treatment with Study Drug,"In the case of pregnancy, the investigator must immediately notify the BMS Medical  Monitor/designee of this event. In most cases, the study drug will be permanently discontinued in  an appropriate manner. If the investigator determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that  warrants continuation of study drug, a discussion between the investigator and the BMS Medical  Monitor/designee must occur.",3.5
61,Discontinuation of Subjects following any Treatment with Study Drug,"All subjects who discontinue study drug will be contacted by telephone 30 days +/- 7 days after  the end of study visit as detailed in Section 3.2 and Table 5.1-2 . The only exception to this  requirement is when a subject withdraws consent for all study procedures including  post-treatment study follow-up or loses the ability to consent freely (ie, is imprisoned or  involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness).",3.5
62,Discontinuation of Subjects following any Treatment with Study Drug,"If study drug is discontinued prior to the subjects completion of the study, the reason for the  discontinuation must be documented in the subjects medical records and entered on the  appropriate case report form (CRF) page.",3.5
63,Post Study Drug Follow up,"In this study, bleeding is a key endpoint of the study. Post study follow-up is of critical  importance and is essential to preserving subject safety and the integrity of the study. Subjects    who discontinue study drug must continue to be followed for collection of outcome and/or  survival follow-up data as required and in line with Section 5 until death or the conclusion of the  study.",3.6
64,Withdrawal of Consent,,3.6.1
65,Lost to Follow-Up,"All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing  status. This includes follow-up with persons authorized by the subject as noted above. Lost to  follow-up is defined by the inability to reach the subject after a minimum of three documented  phone calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by subject to one registered mail letter.  All attempts should be documented in the subjects medical records. If it is determined that the  subject has died, the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.",3.6.2
66,Lost to Follow-Up,"If investigators use of third-party representative to assist in the follow-up portion of the study  has been included in the subjects informed consent, then the investigator may use a  Sponsor-retained third-party representative to assist site staff with obtaining subjects contact  information or other public vital status data necessary to complete the follow-up portion of the  study. The site staff and representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public  health registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. If after all  attempts, the subject remains lost to follow-up, then the last known alive date as determined by  the investigator should be reported and documented in the subjects medical records.",3.6.2
67,Lost to Follow-Up,"Even after multiple unsuccessful contact attempts, no subject should be considered truly lost to  follow-up until the final conclusion of the CV185316 study, as subjects may unexpectedly  present themselves well after their scheduled final visit.",3.6.2
68,STUDY DRUG,Study drug includes both Investigational [Medicinal] Product (IP/IMP) and Non-investigational  [Medicinal] Product (Non-IP/Non-IMP) and can consist of the following:   ,4
69,Investigational Product,"An investigational product, also known as investigational medicinal product in some regions, is  defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a  reference in a clinical study, including products already with a marketing authorization but used  or assembled (formulated or packaged) differently than the authorized form, or used for an  unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form.",4.1
70,Investigational Product,"The investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is  the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that investigational product is only dispensed to  study subjects. The investigational product must be dispensed only from official study sites by  authorized personnel according to local regulations. In this study, apixaban 2.5 mg and 5 mg  tablets, as well as the aspirin 81 mg tablets, aspirin placebo, and VKA are considered  investigational product.",4.1
71,Non-investigational Product,,4.2
72,Storage of Study Drug,"The product storage manager should ensure that the study drug is stored in accordance with the  environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by BMS.

The IVRS will be available 24 hours per day, seven days a week. The subject number will  consist of a unique 5 digit number which is assigned sequentially within a study (starting with  00001) by the IVRS. This number will be used for identification throughout the study and will  not be used for any other subject.",4.4
76,Method of Assigning Subject Identification,"Each subject who meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one of the  two open label treatment groups: apixaban or VKA, with each treatment arm having an  allocation probability of a half (0.50). At the same time, subjects will be randomly assigned in a  blinded fashion to aspirin or matching placebo.",4.4
77,Method of Assigning Subject Identification,The randomization will be stratified by indication at enrollment (PCI/ACS).,4.4
78,Method of Assigning Subject Identification,  ,4.4

108,ADVERSE EVENTS,"An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a  preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subject administered study drug and that  does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease    temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study  drug.",6
109,ADVERSE EVENTS,The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess  all adverse events (AE). The causal relationship can be one of the following: Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and  the AE.,6
110,ADVERSE EVENTS,Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study drug  administration and the AE.,6
111,ADVERSE EVENTS,"The term ""reasonable causal relationship"" means there is evidence to suggest a causal  relationship.",6
112,ADVERSE EVENTS,"Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open-ended questioning,  examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be  questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)",6
113,Serious Adverse Events,"A S erious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death  is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of  the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it  were more severe)  requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization  (see NOTE below)  results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  is a congenital anomaly/birth defect   is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical and  scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical,  surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.)  Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not  result in hospitalization.) Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study  drug is an SAE.",6.1
114,Serious Adverse Events,"Although pregnancy, overdose, cancer, and potential drug induced liver abnormalities are not  always serious by regulatory definition, these events must be handled as SAEs.  (See Section 6.1.1 for reporting pregnancies). Standard medical practice in identifying and  monitoring hepatic abnormalities should be followed.",6.1
115,Serious Adverse Events,"   NOTE : The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in BMS clinical studies: a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not  result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event)  elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent  admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure  routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status  (eg, routine colonoscopy)  medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into  the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases  admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health  status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic  inadequacy, caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason).  Admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs  (applies to oncology protocols)",6.1
116,Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting,"Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) represent the Reference Safety  Information to determine expectedness of serious adverse events for expedited reporting.  Following the subjects written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs must be collected and reported in a timely fashion, including those thought to be associated with protocol-specified  procedures (exemptions to usual SAE reporting are described in section 6.1.1.1 ). All SAEs must  be collected that occur during the screening period and within 30 days of discontinuation of  dosing. The investigator should expeditiously report any SAE that occurs after these time periods  and that is believed to be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure.",6.1.1
117,Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting,An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness.,6.1.1
118,Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting,"If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to  the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication of a study  procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.",6.1.1
119,Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting,"SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS  (or designee) within 24 hours of awareness of the event. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE  Report Form; pregnancies on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). The  preferred method for SAE data reporting collection is through the eCRF. The paper  SAE/pregnancy surveillance forms are only intended as a back-up option when the eCRF system  is not functioning. In this case, the paper forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed  facsimile (fax) transmission to: SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact Information list.",6.1.1
120,Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting,SAE Facsimile Number: Refer to Contact Information list.,6.1.1
121,Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting,"   For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC), electronic submission is the  required method for reporting. The paper forms should be used and submitted immediately, only  in the event the electronic system is unavailable for transmission. When paper forms are used,  the original paper forms are to remain on site.",6.1.1
122,Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting,SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy reporting): Refer to Contact  Information list.,6.1.1
123,Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting,"If only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. (Note: Follow-up  SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.) If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information  becomes available, a follow-up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS  (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.",6.1.1
124,Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting,All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.,6.1.1
125,Protocol Specific Exceptions to SAE Reporting,"Given the body of safety data already collected on apixaban, only targeted SAEs need to be  reported in an expedited fashion. These events include: All deaths (known and unknown cause)  Life threatening events assessed by investigator as related to study drug (excluding  endpoints)  All SAEs that are related (as determined by investigator) to study drug (excluding endpoints)  SAE of interest: liver injury (jaundice, hepatitis, liver failure)  Pregnancies  Overdose So a fatal pneumonia event, for example, regardless of causality, would be reported in the usual  expedited manner as an SAE. But a non-fatal myocardial infarction would not need to be  reported as an SAE; this event would be reported in the endpoint pages of the case report form.",6.1.1.1
126,Protocol Specific Exceptions to SAE Reporting,"Beyond expedited adverse event reporting, clinically important outcome events are being  systematically collected on the electronic case report form and adjudicated by the blinded  clinical events adjudication committee. These events to be adjudicated include: All deaths and the cause of death  All bleeding events  All ischemic events including death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and stroke",6.1.1.1

130,Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting,"Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they  become serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause  interruption or discontinuation of study drug and for those present at the end of study treatment  as appropriate. Reportable nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious AE  page of the CRF (paper or electronic).",6.2.1
131,Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting,Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities  that are reported/identified during the course of the study.,6.2.1
132,Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities,The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE CRF  page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate: Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE   Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to have study drug  discontinued or interrupted  Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to receive specific corrective  therapy.,6.3
133,Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities,"(For subjects randomized to VKA treatment, INR values outside of the therapeutic range need  not be reported unless associated with a clinically apparent adverse event, such as bleeding.) It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by  the reporting investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).",6.3
134,Pregnancy,"If, following initiation of the study drug, it is subsequently discovered that a study subject is  pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposure, including during at least  5 half lives after product administration, the investigator must immediately notify the BMS  Medical Monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance  Form to BMS Designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE  reporting procedures described in Section 6.1.1.",6.4
135,Pregnancy,"In most cases, the study drug will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner  (eg, dose tapering if necessary for subject safety).",6.4
136,Pregnancy,"In the rare event that the benefit of continuing study drug is thought to outweigh the risk, after  consultation with BMS, the pregnant subject may continue study drug after a thorough  discussion of benefits and risk with the subject    Protocol-required procedures for study discontinuation and follow-up must be performed on the  subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (eg, x-ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy  follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated.",6.4
137,Pregnancy,The investigator must immediately notify the BMS (or designee) Medical Monitor of this event  and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form to BMS (or designee) within 24 hours  of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in  Section 6.1.1 .,6.4
138,Pregnancy,"Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal  outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy  Surveillance Form.",6.4

140,Overdose,,6.5
141,Other Safety Considerations,"Any  significant  worsening  noted  during  interim  or  final  physical  examinations, electrocardiogram, x-ray filming, any other potential safety assessment required or not required  by protocol should also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported  accordingly, except those listed those clinical endpoints in section 6.1.1.1 which are exempt from  reporting.",6.6
142,DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE AND OTHER EXTERNAL COMMITTEES,"When required, adjudicated events will be submitted to the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and Health Authorities for review on a specified timeframe in accordance with the adjudication  documentation.",7
143,DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE AND OTHER EXTERNAL COMMITTEES,"The external academic-led committees for this study will include an executive committee,  steering committee, and clinical event adjudication committee. The executive committee will be  a small body comprised of academic and sponsor representatives. The executive committee will  lead the daily decision making for the study. The steering committee will be a larger body  comprised of country-level academic leaders, as well as sponsor representatives, and will meet  periodically at the recommendation of the executive committee. The clinical event adjudication  committee will be an independent body of clinicians who are not otherwise involved with the  study and will evaluate clinical events related to the studys endpoints.",7

146,STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS,,8
147,Sample Size Determination,This is a 2 x 2 factorial design with dual primary objectives. The sample size is based on the  primary set of comparisons between Apixaban vs VKA for the primary endpoint of ISTH major  or CRNM bleeding.,8.1
148,Sample Size Determination,"A total of 357 primary endpoint events and 4600 subjects will provide 77% power for test of  non-inferiority (NI) using a stratified log rank test of apixaban versus VKA, assuming a NI  margin of 1.2, with ISTH major or CRNM bleeding event rates in apixaban and VKA groups of  8.1% per half year and 9% per half year, respectively, one-sided significance level of 0.025, six  month follow up, and a 1% per year of loss to follow up. The NI margin was selected because an  absolute risk difference of greater than 1.8% (20% of VKA event rate of 9%) in bleeding is  considered to be a clinically meaningful difference.",8.1
149,Sample Size Determination,This sample size will also provide at least 77.5% power for superiority test of apixaban versus  VKA assuming a risk reduction of 25% and a two-sided significant level of 0.05.,8.1
150,Sample Size Determination,"A blinded assessment of the primary endpoint event rate will be performed after 50% of subjects  have completed the study. The analyses will focus on the aggregate event rate and the sample  size may be increased if the aggregate event rate is lower than anticipated. The blinded event  rates will be estimated by an independent statistician not associated with BMS and not otherwise  associated with apixaban, and will be provided to the Executive Committee. Sample size may be  adjusted (depending on availability of resources) to provide sufficient power for both  non-inferiority and superiority test on the primary endpoint and first secondary endpoint. Up to a  maximum of subjects may be randomized to maintain appropriate power for both  non-inferiority and superiority test on the primary endpoint and first secondary endpoint to avoid  the potential of futility in this study using the pre-specified rule below. Table 8.1-1 gives a  guideline for sample size adjustment.",8.1
151,Populations for Analyses,The primary safety data set includes all treated subjects who receive at least one dose of study  drug.,8.2
152,Populations for Analyses,"A secondary data set, the evaluable subject data set, is a set of the primary safety data set and  will exclude data from subjects with relevant protocol deviations expected to affect the primary  safety endpoint. Relevant protocol deviations will be pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan.",8.2
