270,Efficacy Assessments,  ,5.5
271,Primary and Secondary Efficacy Assessment,"Response assessments according to the international diagnostic criteria of the International  Myeloma Working Group (IMWG criteria) will be used for the primary analysis. For the  purposes of this study, all subjects tumor assessments by SPEP M protein and UPEP M protein  quantification, corrected calcium (calcium and albumin), and serum free light chain (when  indicated for CR assessment), should be re-evaluated per the protocol-stated frequency relative  to the date of first dose of study drug until disease progression based on the IMWG criteria,  irrespective of dose delays or treatment cycle. If subject does not have documented disease  progression at time of study drug discontinuation, then tumor assessments should still be  performed according to the same schedule described above until disease progression even if  a subsequent anti-myeloma treatment is initiated prior to disease progression.",5.5.1
272,Primary and Secondary Efficacy Assessment,"All efficacy laboratory assessments should be done through the central laboratory, except  corrected calcium, and bone marrow assessments for plasma cell percentage and light chain  restriction (clonality by Immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry). All bone marrow aspirate  and core biopsy samples should be assessed locally. For any SPEP or UPEP assessment  performed locally, in lieu of a central lab assessment, (ie, if the subject cannot complete a visit at    the study site), M protein quantification must be performed. Any laboratory samples analyzed  locally, including for efficacy, must be entered on the appropriate CRF.",5.5.1
273,Laboratory Assessments for Myeloma,"All serum and urine lab tests must be sent to the central lab, except serum calcium and albumin  which are performed locally, until disease progression or withdrawal of consent, even if the  subject is discontinued from study therapy and has started new myeloma therapy.",5.5.2
274,Laboratory Assessments for Myeloma,"Twenty-four-hour urine sample can be collected within 7 days of visit, and must be obtained  with each cycle in all subjects who have measurable UPEP M protein ( 200 mg/24 hours) at  baseline. Subjects who have urine M protein of < 200 mg/24 hours at baseline and at next  2 subsequent assessments do not have to submit q4 week urine samples with each cycle (but  must submit q12 week urine samples) until SPEP M protein values becomes undetectable. In  order to full fill CR/sCR criteria, both serum and urine immunofixation must be performed and  be negative on two consecutive assessment. Therefore, at the time SPEP becomes undetectable,  24-hr UPEP collection should promptly resume and continue q4 weeks until SPEP becomes  detectable. Any local serum and urine myeloma lab tests that may also have been performed  must also be reported in the CRF.",5.5.2
275,Laboratory Assessments for Myeloma,"1) Serum: serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) for M protein quantification, total serum  protein, immunofixation, and quantitative immunoglobulin assay. a) Immunofixation: Immunofixation of serum is required at baseline and to confirm CR  regardless of whether measurable M-protein was present at baseline. b) Serum free light chain: Serum should be collected at screening and time of CR for  serum free light chain analysis. This measurement is required to document sCR. c) Other: All other serum tests will be followed at each tumor assessment. 2) Urine: 24-hour urine collection electrophoresis for M protein quantification, urinary light  chains, and immunofixation. 24-hour urine must be collected with each cycle for all subjects,  except for those subjects with no measurable M protein in the urine at baseline and at next  two subsequent time points. a) Immunofixation of urine is required at baseline and to confirm CR regardless of whether  measurable M-protein was present at baseline. b) All other urine tests will be followed at each tumor assessment. 3) Bone marrow aspiration/biopsy: Assessment of bone marrow for percentage plasma cells  is required within 28 days of randomization and while on study to confirm CR (ie, subjects  who become immunofixation negative) or, if clinically indicated, at time of suspected disease  progression (a second confirmation bone marrow analysis for CR is not needed). The  percentage CD138 cells and clonality (based on kappa/lambda ratio) will also be assessed to  confirm stringent CR (sCR). Flow cytometry will be performed only to confirm CR. In  addition, biomarker tests must also be performed on the fresh bone marrow sample obtained  at screening (if applicable; refer to Section 5.7.2 ).",5.5.2

277,Imaging Assessments for Myeloma,,5.5.3
278,Skeletal Survey,"Skeletal survey, by conventional radiography, for metastatic disease will be performed at  screening (within 28 days prior of randomization), and on study if clinically indicated  (development of compression fracture does not exclude response). Use of conventional or low  dose CT scan (ie, of the spine) or MRI bone survey is acceptable. If imaging is performed on  treatment for assessment of progression, the site must use the same modality of imaging as used  in screening. The number and location of skeletal lesions and whether they are lytic should be    recorded on the eCRF. On treatment survey should record whether there is an increase in the  number or size of lytic lesions.",5.5.3.1
279,Assessment of Extramedullary Plasmacytoma,"CT or MRI should be performed in all subjects if clinically indicated at baseline to assess for the  presence of extramedullary plasmacytoma. To minimize unnecessary radiation in myeloma  subjects where progression is primarily based on serum and urine M-protein, on study  assessments should only be performed if clinically indicated (ie, pain, concern for disease  progression), whether or not present at baseline, and at the time of CR/sCR assessment.",5.5.3.2
280,Assessment of Extramedullary Plasmacytoma,A sum of the products of the longest diameters and longest perpendicular diameter for all  measurable lesions will be calculated at baseline. This sum will be used as the reference for on  study assessments by which to characterize the objective tumor response.,5.5.3.2
281,Assessment of Extramedullary Plasmacytoma,"All tumor measurements must be made in millimeters. All documented measurable lesions are to  be followed throughout the trial. All assessments to be used for tumor response evaluation,  including the baseline assessment, must be performed using the same method for repeat  assessment. CT and MRI scanning are the preferable methods of assessment. Conventional CT  and MRI should be performed with contiguous cuts of 10 mm or less or with cuts of  5 (or 10) mm if spiral CT scanning is used. Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation  by clinical examination. Evaluation by chest x-ray is less preferable than CT or MRI, and should  only be used for well-defined lesions surrounded by aerated lung. Clinical examination is only  acceptable when lesions are superficial, such as a skin nodule or palpable lymph node. Skin  lesions must be documented by a photograph with a ruler. Ultrasound is not acceptable for  documentation of measurable disease.",5.5.3.2
282,Assessment of Extramedullary Plasmacytoma,Duplicate copies of all imaging studies used for tumor response evaluation will be made  available for review by the Sponsor upon request.,5.5.3.2
283,Assessment of Extramedullary Plasmacytoma,Measurable disease are lesions that can be accurately measured in 2 dimensions and both  diameters must be 20 mm when evaluated by standard CT scanning or 10 mm when  evaluated by spiral CT scanning. The minimum diameter size should be at least twice the slice  thickness.,5.5.3.2
284,Assessment of Extramedullary Plasmacytoma,"Non-measurable disease are all other lesions (or sites of disease), including those that are too  small (ie, do not meet above criteria), occur within a previously irradiated area (unless they are  documented as new lesions since the completion of radiation therapy), bone lesions,  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion (exception for effusions  documented by cytology as not malignant or present at baseline without progression),  lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, abdominal masses that are not pathologically/cytologically  confirmed and followed by imaging techniques, and cystic lesions.",5.5.3.2

297,Serious Adverse Events,"A S erious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death  is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of  the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it  were more severe)  requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization (see  NOTE below)  results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  is a congenital anomaly/birth defect   is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical and  scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical,  surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.)    Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not  result in hospitalization.) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an  important medical event. (See Section 6.6 for the definition of potential DILI.) Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study  drug is an SAE.",6.1
298,Serious Adverse Events,"Although pregnancy, overdose, cancer, and potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) are not  always serious by regulatory definition, these events must be handled as SAEs. (See Section  6.1.1 for reporting pregnancies).",6.1
299,Serious Adverse Events,"Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to study therapy (eg, death is an  endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported) should be reported  as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).",6.1

Clinical deterioration will not be  considered progression.",8.3.2.2
341,Progression-Free Survival,The following censoring rules will be applied for PFS: Subjects who receive systemic secondary anti-myeloma therapy prior to documented  progression will be censored on the date of the last tumor assessment prior to the initiation of  the new therapy.  Subjects who have an event (documented progression or death) > 10 weeks (2 assessment  visits) after the last prior tumor assessment will be censored at the last prior assessment.,8.3.2.2
342,Progression-Free Survival,"   Subjects who do not progress and who do not receive subsequent therapy will be censored at  their last tumor assessment.  PFS also will be analyzed applying an intent-to-treat (ITT) definition that utilizes all data on  each randomly assigned subject until either a progression event or the end of the study. PFS  under the ITT definition will be defined as the time from randomization to the date of the  first documented tumor progression or to death due to any cause. Clinical deterioration will  not be considered progression. Subjects who neither progress nor die will be censored on the  date of their last tumor assessment. There will be no censoring for subsequent therapy prior  to progression or for progression events following missing assessments. PFS is elevated from an exploratory endpoint to a secondary endpoint in the protocol amendment  03. The study duration is expanded, and PFS is expected to be sufficiently mature at the updated  targeted follow-up, which is the time of final PFS analysis for the randomized global phase 3  study for the subjects with previously untreated multiple myeloma.",8.3.2.2
